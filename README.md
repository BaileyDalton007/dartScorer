# dartScorer
A program that uses multiple cameras and OpenCV to automatically score a game of darts

There was no reliable way  to tract the tip of the dart on the board with the current camera set up as it was just too small, and since two points on the dart would
be needed to extrapolate the placement on the board I shelfed the project.
